            <AccordionTrigger>Can I use Simpli with an existing project?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Simpli is designed primarily for new projects but can be integrated into existing ones in a few ways:
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                <li>Use the Simpli CLI to generate frontend templates and merge them into your repo</li>
                <li>Extract Simpli components (UI, layouts, themes) and drop them into your Next.js app</li>
                <li>Leverage Simpli&apos;s prebuilt structure while keeping your backend setup</li>
              </ul>
              While Simpli works best for starting new projects, parts of it can be adopted into existing workflows.
